<h2>Diagnostics</h2>

<h3>Session server</h3>
<p>RED is using small python script <code>robot_session_server.py</code> as a bridge between the IDE itself and
your <b>Robot Framework</b> installation. This is needed for various reasons: checking RF version so that files
are validated accordingly, generating library documentations, running <b>RfLint</b>, providing variables from 
python files and so on.
</p>

<p>Sometimes when diagnosing problems with RED it may be desirable to take a look at operations performed by 
<code>robot_session_server.py</code> process. By default this server runs in background invisibly for users.
There are however two possibilities to have a deeper look. 
</p>

<h4>1. Displaying server console</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Exit RED
    </li>
    <li>edit <code>RED.ini</code> file (or <code>eclipse.ini</code> if you're using eclipse with RED installed as 
    a feature)
    </li>
    <li>add <code>-Dred.showSessionConsole=true</code> line somewhere after <code>-vmargs</code> line
    </li>
    <li>start RED/eclipse again
    </li>
</ol>
<p>After starting again there should be server output visible in <b>Console</b> view. Server is logging every call
coming from RED together with arguments as well as results/exceptions of that call.
</p>

<h4>2. Running server manually and connecting to it</h4>

<p>Firstly server script files has to be obtained. They can be downloaded from 
<a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nokia/RED/tree/master/src/RobotFrameworkCore/org.robotframework.ide.core-functions/src/main/python/scripts">
GitHub
</a> (all files except <code>TestRunnerAgent.py</code> are needed). Alternatively those files can be copied from
temporary directory of your system when RED is running: go to temporary directory and look for a directory with
name starting from <code>RobotTempDir</code> containing same python files as on GitHub.
</p> 

<ol>
    <li>Start server by issuing:
        <div class="code">python robot_session_server.py 12345
        </div>
        in command line
    </li>
    <li>this will start server on port <code>12345</code> at <code>localhost</code>
    </li>
    <li>exit RED
    </li>
    <li>edit <code>RED.ini</code> file (or <code>eclipse.ini</code> if you're using eclipse with RED installed as 
    a feature)
    </li>
    <li>add <code>-Dred.connectToServerAt=127.0.0.1:12345</code> line somewhere after <code>-vmargs</code> line
    </li>
    <li>start RED/eclipse again
    </li>
</ol>

<p>After starting again RED should connect to manually started session server.
