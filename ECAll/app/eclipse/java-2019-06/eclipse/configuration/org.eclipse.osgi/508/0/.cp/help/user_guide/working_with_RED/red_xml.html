<h1>General information about red.xml</h1>
<p>Red.xml is file which stores Project related settings, some of those controls editing phase (validation, code assistance etc.), other can influence RobotFramework execution.</p>
<p>It is always located in Project's root.</p>

<h2>Creating/recreating red.xml</h2>
<p>Red.xml is automatically created when Robot project is created by action from <b><code>File -&gt; New -&gt; Robot Project</code></b>.</p>
<p>In case of importing robot files to generic Eclipse project, right click on Project in Project Explorer and select <b><code>Robot Framework -&gt; Add Robot nature</code></b> to create red.xml</p>

<p><b>Libraries</b> - holds a list of discovered or manually added libraries. It is divided to <b>Referenced libraries</b> and <b>Remote locations</b>.</p>
<p>More info under topic <a href="libs.html">Recognizing external libraries in RED<a></p>
<p><b>Paths</b> - holds settings for user defined Python/ClassPath which are used for Libraries discovery and testcase execution, additionally relative paths relativity can be changed from Workspace to Project.</p>

<h3>Variables tab</h3>
<p>This section holds everything related to Robot variables.</p>
<p><b>Variable mappings</b> - values can be assigned to variables, this is used to resolved parameterized paths. </p>
<p>More info under topic <a href='variable_mapping.html'>Variable mapping - dealing with parameterized paths to libraries and resources</a> </p>
<p><b>Variable files</b> - this tab specify variable files which should be visible on global scope. Those global variable files are used during testcase edit and validation.</p>
<p>More info under topic <a href="variable_files.html">Variable Files - using files with variable accessible anywhere inside Project</a>.</p>

<h3>Validation tab</h3>
<p>This section allows user to limit validation to selected folder or exclude selected folder from validation. To exclude folder in Project, right click on folder and choose <i>Exclude</i> from menu. Files can be also excluded by fixed size [KB]. </p>
