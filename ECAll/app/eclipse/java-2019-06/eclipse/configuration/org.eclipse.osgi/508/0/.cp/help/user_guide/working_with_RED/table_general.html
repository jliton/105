<h2>Table Editors - general usage hints</h2>

<h3>Jump to Source, View in Table Editor</h3>
Clicking on element in Source and pressing F4 key will open respectful Table editor.<br>
The same work other way around - element from Table editor is shown in Source.

<h3>Undo - CTRL+Z actions in Table Editors</h3>
Those table actions groups are independent from each other which means that CTRL+Z reverts only in active table editor even when there were other actions performed in another table editor in between.<br>
Each table editor stores theirs list of performed actions which can be reverted by CTRL+Z. <br>
Note that due to table to source synchronization, revertible actions are discarded when switching to Source editor. </br>
