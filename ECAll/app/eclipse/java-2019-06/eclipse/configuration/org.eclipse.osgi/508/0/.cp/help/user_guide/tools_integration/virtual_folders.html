	<h2>Working with virtual folders mounted via SSH</h2>
	<p>If there is a need to work with remote folders mounted as SSH,
		this can be done in multiple way.</p>

	<dl class="note">
		<dt>Note</dt>
		<dd>RED is parsing each file during validation thus you may
			experience reduce validation speed due to slower access to remote
			folders.</dd>

			<h3>Folder mount on OS level</h3>

			<p>Folders can be mounted as separate drive or mount points in
				the OS file system (eg. using sshfs for Windows).</p>

			<p>This is preferred way to work with remote folders. RED uses
				local Robot and Python to execute actions on remote files to get
				information about libraries or variables from Python modules.</p>

			<p>When including such folder into Project, use appropriate
				option in Advanced menu while creating or importing such folder
				(link to folder).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Remote System Explorer plugin</h3>

			<p>
				Another way of accessing such remote locations is to use Eclipse
				plugin <a target="_blank" class="external" 
					href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/remote-system-explorer-ssh-telnet-ftp-and-dstore-protocols">
					Remote System Explorer</a>
			</p>
			<p>This plugin allows to access to remote folders only inside
				Eclipse application. RED will not be able to read and validate
				python variable files, generate libspecs from users libraries.</p>

				<dt>Warning</dt>
				<dd>It was seen that RSE might cause Eclipse to be unresponsive
					while waiting for establish connection.</dd>
