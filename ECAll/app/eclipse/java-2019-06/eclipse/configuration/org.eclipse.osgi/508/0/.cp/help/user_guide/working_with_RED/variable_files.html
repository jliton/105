<h2>General info about Python variable files used in Robot Test Suites</h2>
RobotFramework allows to use Python variable files in Robot Test Suites in two distinctive ways.<br>
<b>Direct usage</b> is done by using python file declaration in Settings section as follows:<br>
<i>Variables  &ltpath_to_python_var_file&gt</i><br><br>
Variable file content will be visible across Test Suite.<br>
<b>Global usage</b> is a way to use common variable file across any Test Suite.<br>
In RED, this can be achieved by including variable files in RED.xml under Variable Files tab. <br>
From Robot perspective this is done by using -V switch in command line.<br></br>

<h2>Local Python variable files to deal with missing variables</h2>
In some test environments, Robot specific environments variables are used in test cases or injected as arguments to Robot test runner. <br>
RED is not aware of such usage thus those variables will be marked as unknown, error marker will be placed.<br>
In order to include variable name validation without changing test suites, user can create local Python file with list of variable names inside.<br>
Such file can be included in RED.xml under Variable files section thus making RED aware of previously unknown variables. <br>
Variables from such file will be visible as Global variables for all Robot files inside Project.<br>

<dl class="note">
    <dt>Note</dt>
    <dd>Variables provided in red.xml are used only by RED for validation purpose and are not added to Robot run command line.</br>
    During test execution variables have to be provided by Robot.</dd>
</dl>

Below is a sample body of such Python variable file (examples can be also found in RobotFramework official manual and Python examples). 
<br><br><img src="images/var_files_red_xml.gif"> <br><br>
<br>
<code><br>
#!python <br>
<br>
#Sample variables and values<br>
Scalar = 'value'<br>
UserList = ['value1','value2']<br>
UserDict ={'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2'}<br>
</code>
<br>

<h2>Reloading variable file content</h2>
Since version 0.6.6, RED can automatically invoke refresh of variable files being changed.<br>
This can be done manually by clicking on Project by RMB and selecting <b><code>Robot Framework -&gt; Reset Robot Environment</code></b> <br>
