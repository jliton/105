	<h2>Robot Framework Lint analysis</h2>

	<p>Starting with RED 0.8.1 it is possible to run <a target="_blank" class="external" 
		href="http://github.com/boakley/robotframework-lint/">Robot Framework Lint</a> 
	analysis tool. Of course one have to have it installed in the python installation
	used by the project.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Running RfLint</h3>
	<p>RfLint can be run on selected file or folder (or whole project) in <b>Project Explorer</b> view. In order
	to start analysis open context menu for selected resource and choose <b><code>Robot Framework -&gt; Run RfLint analysis</code></b>.
	</p>

	<p>The analysis should start and its progress is visible in <b>Progress</b> view. At any time you can abort running
	validation:
	</p>
	<img src="images/rflint_progress.png"/>
	
	<p>Analysis performed from RED is reporting all the findings as <b>Problem markers</b> of a separate type called
	<b>RfLint Problem</b>. This is a different type than those reported by standard RED <a href="../validation.html">
	validation</a> mechanism (they have <b>Robot Problem</b> type). Overall this means that the findings are visible
	in <b>Problems</b> view and are also visible in editors. 
	</p>
	<img src="images/rflint_problems.png"/>
	
	<p>In order to remove problems simply choose <b><code>Robot Framework -&gt; Clean RfLint problems</code></b> from context menu
	of selected resource.
	</p>
	
	<dl class="note">
	   <dt>Note</dt>
	   <dd>Robot Framework Lint analysis is not run on excluded project parts (see more under topic <a href="../validation/scope.html">Limiting validation scope</a>.
	   </dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Configuration</h3>
	
	<p>It is possible to configure RfLint behavior in Preferences (
		<code><a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.rflint)')">
		Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Robot Framework -&gt; Errors/Warnings -&gt; RfLint validation</a></code>).
	</p>
	
    <img src="images/rflint_preferences.png"/>
	
	<p>The table shows all available rules grouped by the source files where they are defined. It is possible
	to:
	</p>
	
    
	<ul>
	    <li>add <b>additional rules files</b> - those files will be attached with all the rules when running RfLint 
	    analysis,
	    <p/>
	    <li><b>ignore</b> rules - by checking/unchecking them. By default all the rules are not ignored. It is also
	    possible to check/uncheck file which will apply to all the rules from this file,
	    <p/>
	    </li>
        <li>define rule <b>severity</b> - each rule can have severity specified: <b>Error</b> and <b>Warning</b>.
        Similarly one can change severity of a file which would change severities of all its rules, 
        <p/>
        </li>
        <li>rule <b>configuration</b> - as described in <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://github.com/boakley/robotframework-lint/wiki/How-to-write-custom-rules">RfLint Wiki</a>
        some rules can be parameterized: simply write arguments for given rule and remember that multiple arguments
        should be separated with colon (:) character.
        <p/>
        </li>
	</ul>

	<p>The preference page displays the rule documentation in order to have a quick rule overview. Custom command
	line arguments for RfLint can be passed using <b>Additional arguments for RfLint</b> field - refer toe RfLint 
	user guide for more details on possible arguments.
	</p>
	<br/>
	
    <h3>Displaying rules documentation</h3>
    
    <p>It is possible to see the rule documentation straight from <b>Problems</b> view by using context menu
    action on given RfLint problem. The documentation will be displayed in <b>Documentation</b> view.
